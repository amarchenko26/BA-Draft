\caption*{Notes: This table presents the categories according to which Research Assistants coded the race, sex, and age of the hosts and reviewers. Each host was assigned one category from each column. White refers only to non-Hispanic Whites. The Unknown categories are for profile pictures that are non-human, had more than one person, had only children, or did not contain a face. Multiracial is for pictures with two people of different race. For main results, only Male/Female and White/Black/Hispanic/Asian were included, as interactions.}
