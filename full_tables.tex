Model 2 controls for listing location to the neighborhood level and demographic and economic health characteristics on the zipcode-level.

The omitted category for room type is Entire Apartment. I could not control for host social media accounts as a proxy for host reliability like Edelman \& Luca did, because Airbnb no longer provides this information. Instead, I controlled for ``host verified", a dummy for whether Airbnb has the host's phone number and email. I was not able to control for ``picture quality" either, but picture quality did not significantly influence price in Edelman \& Luca's regression.

When a listing is booked, this availability metric is updated on the Airbnb website to reflect that booking. Therefore, this measure actually represents the number of days out of the total available days that listings were vacant, relative to a White male host.

Each set of coefficients represents the coefficient on host race, with log price as the outcome variable. I control for my preferred specification throughout. Low number of observations for Black, Hispanic, and Asian hosts contribute to imprecise estimates in smaller cities (New Orleans, Nashville have less than 100 Hispanic and Asian hosts; DC and Austin have less than 200 such hosts).

Each coefficient is the standardized sentiment of a review. Review sentiment measures how positive or negative the review is. Reviews that are numerically positive are of positive sentiment and numerically negative are negative sentiment, relative to the mean sentiment score for each host type. The unit of observation is a single review. The data is a subsample of the Chicago hosts and their reviewers. I control for my preferred specification throughout.

The unit of observation is an Airbnb listing, so hosts who have multiple listings are treated separately each time. The sample is the sample of listings across 7 US cities. The specification is the same as Table \ref{table:price}.
