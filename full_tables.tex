Model 1 is the baseline effect of host demographics on price. Model 2 includes fixed effects for the neighborhood of the listing and Census demographic, economic health characteristics, and occupancy rates on the zipcode-level. Model 3 adds listing characteristics such as the property type and size. Model 4 adds host characteristics such as response and acceptance rates, and measures of host effort.

The outcome variable is the standardized sentiment of the review, as assigned by a machine learning algorithm. Reviews that are numerically positive are of positive sentiment and numerically negative are negative sentiment, relative to the mean sentiment score for each host type. The unit of observation is a single review. The data is a subsample of the Chicago hosts and their reviewers. I control for the specification in Table \ref{table:price}, Model 4.

The omitted category for room type is Entire Apartment. I could not control for host social media accounts as a proxy for host reliability like \cite{edelman} did, because Airbnb no longer provides this information. Instead, I controll for ``host verified", a dummy for whether Airbnb has the host's phone number and email. I similarly can not control for ``picture quality", but picture quality did not significantly influence price in \cite{edelman}'s regression.
