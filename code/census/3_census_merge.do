/*						Explaining Thiago's work
STEP 1: Loads the data, destrings zipcode and renames it in preparation for merge

STEP 2: Calculates racial percentages & Normalizes per zipcode. This is done because 
there are 8 variables for race: 001 [TOTAL], 002 [White], 003 [Black], 004 [Native American], 
005 [Asian], 006 [Hawaiian], 007 [Some Other], 008 [Two or More Races]
		NOTE: We do NOT have Hispanics
		NOTE: Some Other Race is shortened as sor 
		NOTE: 008, 006 and 004 are grouped as hnom [Hawaiian, Native, or More]
		NOTE: For ease of use, this is the format I use for variable names:
				`variable'_`category'_`area'_`metric' e.g. `race_white'_`zip/city'_`norm/percentage'
				
STEP 3: In order to group variables by city, I created a dta file with the cleaned 
version of our data [e.g. once it passes through the main cleaning do files], 
merged it with the census data and kept unique zipcodes only. 
		I only kept merge == 3.

STEP 4: Using this new data set, we can now create all of the variables needed. I already 
created a few which can act as a template for creating the remainder. 

STEP 5: Once we create all of the variables, we can merge this dataset to the main cleaned data.
