My results are nearly identical to theirs (their coefficient on Black hosts was -17.8) when controlling for similar covariates in the same city. The omitted category for race is White hosts. The omitted category for room type is Entire Apartment. I could not control for host social media accounts as a proxy for host reliability like Edelman \& Luca did, because Airbnb no longer provides this information. Instead, I controlled for ``host verified", a boolean for whether Airbnb has the host's phone number and email. I was not able to control for ``picture quality" either, but picture quality did not significantly influence price in Edelman \& Luca's regression.

When a listing is booked, this availability metric is updated on the Airbnb website to reflect that booking. Therefore, this measure actually represents the number of days out of the total available days that listings were vacant, relative to a white male host.

Low number of observations for Black, Hispanic, and Asian hosts contribute to imprecise estimates in smaller cities. New Orleans and Nashville have less than 100 Hispanic and Asian hosts.

Each coefficient is the standardized sentiment of a review. Review sentiment measures how positive or negative the review is. Reviews that are numerically positive are of positive sentiment and numerically negative are negative sentiment, relative to the mean sentiment score for each host type. The unit of observation is a single review. The data is a subsample of the Chicago hosts and their reviewers. I control for my preferred specification throughout (referred to as Model 4 in Table 5).
