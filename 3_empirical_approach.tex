% EMPIRICAL APPROACH
\label{empirical}

I use OLS to estimate the impact of host race on listing price on Airbnb, controlling for location, property, and host characteristics. My main specification is of the form:

\[ log(\text{Price}_{i,j}) = \alpha_i + \beta_1 \text{Race}_{i} \;  \text{X} \; \text{Sex}_i + \beta_2 \text{Age}_i + \beta_3 \text{Location} +  x_{i,j} \]

Where $log(\text{Price}_{i,j})$ is the log of host $i$'s price from their Airbnb listing $j$. For hosts with multiple listings, each listing is treated separately. $\text{Race}_{i} \;  \text{X} \; \text{Sex}_i$ is the interaction of the race and sex of the host, where white males are the omitted category throughout. $\text{Age}_i$ is a dummy variable for whether the host is young, middle-aged, or senior. $x_{i,j}$ is a vector of property and host controls that grows additively in each model. Each column of Tables \ref{table:price} and \ref{table:reviews} controls for everything in the previous columns, plus a new set of covariates, as detailed below. All other tables control only for the full specification, Model 4. Standard errors are clustered by neighborhood throughout.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Model 1} presents the raw effect of host race and sex on the price of a listing. These coefficients are consistent with the mean listing prices by race presented in Table \ref{table:listing}, but further broken down by male and female hosts within each racial category.
	
	\item \textit{Model 2} adds city and neighborhood fixed effects, as well as Census information on demographics and various indicators of economic health at the zipcode level. Since race is highly correlated with location, and a listing's location primarily determines access to amenities, I expect that a large amount of variation in Airbnb prices between racial groups can be explained by these location controls.
	
	\item \textit{Model 3} adds controls for listing-specific characteristics. See Table \ref{table:listing} for a full list of controls. 
	
	\item \textit{Model 4} represents my full specification. I add all remaining host-dependent fields on the listing page, such whether the host is a Superhost, the host's response time, and their cancellation policy. Importantly, I also attempt to control for variation in unobservable host effort. To this end, I add host effort variables to differentiate hosts who write longer descriptions and use longer words in those descriptions. I also conduct sentiment analysis of the text on the listing page to control for hosts who write more objective descriptions of more positive valence. See Table \ref{table:covariates} for details of controls and Section \ref{data} for details of construction of host effort variables.
