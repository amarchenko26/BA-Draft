% EMPIRICAL APPROACH
\label{empirical}

I use OLS to estimate the impact of host race on listing price on Airbnb, controlling for location, property, and host characteristics. My main specification is of the form:

\[ log(\text{Price}_{i,j}) = \alpha_i + \beta_1 \text{Race}_{i} \;  \text{X} \; \text{Sex}_i + \beta_2 \text{Age}_i + \beta_3 \text{Location} +  x_{i,j} \]

Where $log(\text{Price}_{i,j})$ is the log of host $i$'s price from their Airbnb listing $j$. For hosts with multiple listings, each listing is treated separately. $\text{Race}_{i} \;  \text{X} \; \text{Sex}_i$ is the interaction of the race and sex of the host, where white males are the omitted category throughout. $\text{Age}_i$ is a dummy variable for whether the host is young, middle-aged, or senior. $x_{i,j}$ is a vector of property and host controls that grows additively in each model. Each column of Tables 5 and 7 [SUB IN FOR REFERENCES] controls for everything in the previous columns, plus a new set of covariates. All other tables control for the full specification, as decribed in Model 4. Standard errors are clustered by neighborhood throughout.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textit{Model 1} presents the raw effect of host race and sex on the price of a listing. These coefficients are consistent with the mean listing prices by race presented in Table \ref{table:listing}, but further broken down by male and female hosts within each racial category.
	
	\item \textit{Model 2} adds city and neighborhood fixed effects. Since race is highly correlated with location and therefore the price of the listing, I expect that a large amount of variation in Airbnb prices between racial groups can be explained by listing location. I also include Census data 
	
	\item \textit{Model 3} adds controls for listing-specific characteristics. See Table \ref{table:listing} for a full list of controls. 
	
	\item \textit{Model 4} represents my full specification. I add all remaining host-dependent fields on the listing page, such whether the host is a Superhost, the host's response time, and their cancellation policy. Importantly, I also attempt to control for variation in unobservable host effort. To this end, I construct host effort variables to differentiate hosts who write longer descriptions and use longer words in those descriptions. I also conduct sentiment analysis of the text on the listing page to control for hosts who write more objective descriptions of more positive valence. See Table \ref{table:covariates} for details of controls and Section \ref{data} for details of construction of host effort variables.
